Release Notes for 1.1.1
========= 
Some RANet Fixes
PH Expansion average fix
DDNS Implementation
HTTP Basic Authentication added
KalkDoser functions added
Inclusion of SunLocation, Moon, and Tide classes
New Class TimedPort with built in timers, stop/start runtimes, OSC function
Implementation of Feeding/WaterChange Speeds for RF module
PAR Expansion Module support added
WiFiAlert class added

WaterLevel Module Changes
	MultiChannel WaterLevel support added
	WaterLevel will no longer wrap below 0%

DCPump Changes - 
	LowATOChannel support to go with HighATOChannel support that was always there.
	16Channel PWM support
	New modes added to DCPump and in Globals - Else, Gyre, and Sine modes
          If you have Else or Sine in your INO file they should be removed as they are now
          included in the Libraries and are valid DCPump modes.
		Example: DCPump.Mode = Else;
	Threshold to limit speed at 30% cutoff. Can be set in Memory or in INO
		Example: DCPump.Threshold = 30;
	Gyre mode is similar to Long Pulse, except instead of the pump turning on and off at the full speed
	  it uses a Sine profile to ramp up to the full speed and ramp back down, alternating between sync 
          and anti-sync.  By default the running pump goes from the DCPump threshold to full and back down.
	AntiSyncOffset - Set an offset to increase/decrease the secondary pump
	Feeding and WaterChange speed default changed to 255 (Disabled if >100)

PWM Changes
	16Channel Module support added
	Offset expanded to include Pre/Post Offsets
	HighRes functions added for up to 12bit resolution or 4095 levels.
	Dimming ports on the relay box and the old-style 6 channel PWM expansion use 8bit dimming or 255 levels.
	Higher Resolution PWM functions used internally for the PWM functions like PWMSlope, PWMParabola, etc.
	New PWM curves added 
		PWMSmoothRamp (slope with smooth transitions) 
		PWMSigmoid (Bell-curve, parabola with smooth transitions)

16Channel Usage Notes:

- To activate 16 Channel dimming module add the line "ReefAngel.Add16ChPWM();" to your INO file somewhere.
- The 16 channel dimmer channels can be used as DCPump channels 
	Example: DCPump.SIXTEENChExpansionChannel[0]=sync
- To run slope, parabola, smoothramp, or Sigmoid light profiles you can address them as 
  	Example: ReefAngel.PWM.SIXTEENChannelPWMSlope();
- To set the channel values directly in your INO file using a profile you have written or using one of the
  profiles in Globals you can do it as:
	Example: ReefAngel.PWM.Set16Channel(channel,percent);

Higher Resolution Usage Notes:

- To set the channel value if you want to make sure that you are using all 4095 levels of dimming you can use 
  the "HighRes" and Raw versions in Globals and in PWM, respectively.
	Example: ReefAngel.PWM.SetChannelRaw(0,PWMSigmoidHighRes(startHour,startMinute,endHour,endMinute,startPWM,endPWM,0))
- Note that the 16 channel dimmer and newer versions of the 6 channel dimmer support 12 bits (4095), other dimmers
  support 8 bits (255).  Values used to be set internally based upon percents, which was 100 levels of dimming.  The 
  difference won't be noticeable except at very dim levels.
- If you are using the GetChannelValue(), GetDaylightValue() type functions in your INO file they will still 
  return percentages, not raw values.
- If you want the raw value being sent to the PWM you can use GetChannelValueRaw() to get the raw bit value being
  sent to the PWM chipset.
